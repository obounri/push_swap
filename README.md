# push_swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

The goal is to write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that
sorts the integer arguments received.
